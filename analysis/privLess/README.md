# PrivLess Output Analysis

Notebooks that analyze the usage-based policies generated by the PrivLess pipeline and compare them against developer-declared defaults to quantify over-privilege.

## Notebooks

### runtime_analysis.ipynb

Evaluates the runtime performance of the PrivLess pipeline.

**Input:** `output/results/stats/combined_analysis_stats-time.csv`

Key analyses:
- Runtime breakdown by stage (CodeQL DB creation, service-call query, resource query, analysis)
- CDF and box plots of per-stage durations
- Mean, median, and standard deviation statistics

### privLess_policy_analysis.ipynb

Side-by-side comparison of default policies versus PrivLess-generated usage-based policies, quantifying over-privilege.

**Inputs:**
- `output/results/default_policy_analysis/combined_default_policy_stats.jsonl` (default policies)
- `output/results/stats/combined_analysis_stats.jsonl` (PrivLess policies)

Key analyses:
- Over-privilege ratio (default permissions vs. actually needed)
- Permission reduction statistics per app and per function
- Missing and extraneous permission identification
- Service-level comparison

## Running

Make sure you have completed the prerequisite steps described in the [parent README](../README.md), then open the notebooks in Jupyter:

```bash
cd analysis/privLess
jupyter notebook
```
